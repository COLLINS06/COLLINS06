A left rotation operation on an array shifts each of the array elements 1 unit to the left.
For example, if 2 left rotation are performed on array [1,2,3,4,5], then the array would become [3,4,5,1,2]. Note that the lowest index item moves to the highest index in a rotation. This is called circular array.

Given an array a of n integers and a number, d, perform d left rotations on the array. Return the updated array to be printed as a single line of space-separated integers. 

Create the function rotLeft in the editor below.
rotLeft has the following parameter(s):

1: int a[n] the array to rotate
2. int d: the number of rotations

when we perform d=4 left rotatations, the arra undergoes the following changes:
[1,2,3,4,5] -> [2,3,4,5,1] -> [3,4,5,1,2] -> [4,5,1,2,3] -> [5,1,2,3,1]
